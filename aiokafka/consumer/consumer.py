class AIOKafkaConsumer(object):
    """
    A client that consumes records from a Kafka cluster.

    The consumer will transparently handle the failure of servers in the Kafka
    cluster, and adapt as topic-partitions are created or migrate between
    brokers. It also interacts with the assigned kafka Group Coordinator node
    to allow multiple consumers to load balance consumption of topics (feature
    of kafka >= 0.9.0.0).

    .. _create_connection:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html\
        #creating-connections

    Arguments:
        *topics (str): optional list of topics to subscribe to. If not set,
            call subscribe() or assign() before consuming records. Passing
            topics directly is same as calling ``subscribe()`` API.
        bootstrap_servers: 'host[:port]' string (or list of 'host[:port]'
            strings) that the consumer should contact to bootstrap initial
            cluster metadata. This does not have to be the full node list.
            It just needs to have at least one broker that will respond to a
            Metadata API Request. Default port is 9092. If no servers are
            specified, will default to localhost:9092.
        client_id (str): a name for this client. This string is passed in
            each request to servers and can be used to identify specific
            server-side log entries that correspond to this client. Also
            submitted to GroupCoordinator for logging with respect to
            consumer group administration. Default: 'aiokafka-{version}'
        group_id (str or None): name of the consumer group to join for dynamic
            partition assignment (if enabled), and to use for fetching and
            committing offsets. If None, auto-partition assignment (via
            group coordinator) and offset commits are disabled.
            Default: None
        key_deserializer (callable): Any callable that takes a
            raw message key and returns a deserialized key.
        value_deserializer (callable, optional): Any callable that takes a
            raw message value and returns a deserialized value.
        fetch_min_bytes (int): Minimum amount of data the server should
            return for a fetch request, otherwise wait up to
            fetch_max_wait_ms for more data to accumulate. Default: 1.
        fetch_max_wait_ms (int): The maximum amount of time in milliseconds
            the server will block before answering the fetch request if
            there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy the
            requirement given by fetch_min_bytes. Default: 500.
        max_partition_fetch_bytes (int): The maximum amount of data
            per-partition the server will return. The maximum total memory
            used for a request = #partitions * max_partition_fetch_bytes.
            This size must be at least as large as the maximum message size
            the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to
            send messages larger than the consumer can fetch. If that
            happens, the consumer can get stuck trying to fetch a large
            message on a certain partition. Default: 1048576.
        max_poll_records (int): The maximum number of records returned in a
            single call to ``getmany()``. Defaults ``None``, no limit.
        request_timeout_ms (int): Client request timeout in milliseconds.
            Default: 40000.
        retry_backoff_ms (int): Milliseconds to backoff when retrying on
            errors. Default: 100.
        auto_offset_reset (str): A policy for resetting offsets on
            OffsetOutOfRange errors: 'earliest' will move to the oldest
            available message, 'latest' will move to the most recent. Any
            ofther value will raise the exception. Default: 'latest'.
        enable_auto_commit (bool): If true the consumer's offset will be
            periodically committed in the background. Default: True.
        auto_commit_interval_ms (int): milliseconds between automatic
            offset commits, if enable_auto_commit is True. Default: 5000.
        check_crcs (bool): Automatically check the CRC32 of the records
            consumed. This ensures no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to
            the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so it may
            be disabled in cases seeking extreme performance. Default: True
        metadata_max_age_ms (int): The period of time in milliseconds after
            which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any
            partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new
            brokers or partitions. Default: 300000
        partition_assignment_strategy (list): List of objects to use to
            distribute partition ownership amongst consumer instances when
            group management is used. This preference is implicit in the order
            of the strategies in the list. When assignment strategy changes:
            to support a change to the assignment strategy, new versions must
            enable support both for the old assignment strategy and the new
            one. The coordinator will choose the old assignment strategy until
            all members have been updated. Then it will choose the new
            strategy. Default: [RoundRobinPartitionAssignor]
        heartbeat_interval_ms (int): The expected time in milliseconds
            between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using
            Kafka's group management feature. Heartbeats are used to ensure
            that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate
            rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The
            value must be set lower than session_timeout_ms, but typically
            should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be
            adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal
            rebalances. Default: 3000
        session_timeout_ms (int): The timeout used to detect failures when
            using Kafka's group managementment facilities. Default: 30000
        consumer_timeout_ms (int): maximum wait timeout for background fetching
            routine. Mostly defines how fast the system will see rebalance and
            request new data for new partitions. Default: 200
        api_version (str): specify which kafka API version to use.
            AIOKafkaConsumer supports Kafka API versions >=0.9 only.
            If set to 'auto', will attempt to infer the broker version by
            probing various APIs. Default: auto
        security_protocol (str): Protocol used to communicate with brokers.
            Valid values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL. Default: PLAINTEXT.
        ssl_context (ssl.SSLContext): pre-configured SSLContext for wrapping
            socket connections. Directly passed into asyncio's
            `create_connection`_. For more information see :ref:`ssl_auth`.
            Default: None.
        exclude_internal_topics (bool): Whether records from internal topics
            (such as offsets) should be exposed to the consumer. If set to True
            the only way to receive records from an internal topic is
            subscribing to it. Requires 0.10+ Default: True
        connections_max_idle_ms (int): Close idle connections after the number
            of milliseconds specified by this config. Default: 540000 (9hours).

    Note:
        Many configuration parameters are taken from Java Client:

        Prefetched messages are returned in batches by topic-partition.
        If messages is not available in the prefetched buffer this method waits

        Arguments:
            partitions (List[TopicPartition]): The partitions that need
                fetching message. If no one partition specified then all
                subscribed partitions will be used

                with any records that are available currently in the buffer,
                else returns empty. Must not be negative. Default: 0
        Returns:
