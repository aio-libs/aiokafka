class AIOKafkaProducer(object):
    """A Kafka client that publishes records to the Kafka cluster.

    The producer consists of a pool of buffer space that holds records that
    haven't yet been transmitted to the server as well as a background task
    that is responsible for turning these records into requests and
    transmitting them to the cluster.

    The send() method is asynchronous. When called it adds the record to a
    buffer of pending record sends and immediately returns. This allows the
    producer to batch together individual records for efficiency.

    The 'acks' config controls the criteria under which requests are considered
    complete. The "all" setting will result in waiting for all replicas to
    respond, the slowest but most durable setting.

    The key_serializer and value_serializer instruct how to turn the key and
    value objects the user provides into bytes.

    Arguments:
        bootstrap_servers: 'host[:port]' string (or list of 'host[:port]'
            strings) that the producer should contact to bootstrap initial
            cluster metadata. This does not have to be the full node list.
            It just needs to have at least one broker that will respond to a
            Metadata API Request. Default port is 9092. If no servers are
            specified, will default to localhost:9092.
        client_id (str): a name for this client. This string is passed in
            each request to servers and can be used to identify specific
            server-side log entries that correspond to this client.
            Default: 'aiokafka-producer-#' (appended with a unique number
            per instance)
        key_serializer (callable): used to convert user-supplied keys to bytes
            If not None, called as f(key), should return bytes. Default: None.
        value_serializer (callable): used to convert user-supplied message
            values to bytes. If not None, called as f(value), should return
            bytes. Default: None.
        acks (0, 1, 'all'): The number of acknowledgments the producer requires
            the leader to have received before considering a request complete.
            This controls the durability of records that are sent. The
            following settings are common:

            0: Producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server
                at all. The message will immediately be added to the socket
                buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the
                server has received the record in this case, and the retries
                configuration will not take effect (as the client won't
                generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each
                record will always be set to -1.
            1: The broker leader will write the record to its local log but
                will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all
                followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately
                after acknowledging the record but before the followers have
                replicated it then the record will be lost.
            all: The broker leader will wait for the full set of in-sync
                replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the
                record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica
                remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.

            If unset, defaults to acks=1.
        compression_type (str): The compression type for all data generated by
            the producer. Valid values are 'gzip', 'snappy', 'lz4', or None.
            Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching
            will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better
            compression). Default: None.
        max_batch_size (int): Maximum size of buffered data per partition.
            After this amount `send` coroutine will block until batch is
            drained.
            Default: 16384
        linger_ms (int): The producer groups together any records that arrive
            in between request transmissions into a single batched request.
            Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster
            than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client
            may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load.
            This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of
            artificial delay; that is, if first request is processed faster,
            than `linger_ms`, producer will wait `linger_ms - process_time`.
            This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay).
        partitioner (callable): Callable used to determine which partition
            each message is assigned to. Called (after key serialization):
            partitioner(key_bytes, all_partitions, available_partitions).
            The default partitioner implementation hashes each non-None key
            using the same murmur2 algorithm as the Java client so that
            messages with the same key are assigned to the same partition.
            When a key is None, the message is delivered to a random partition
            (filtered to partitions with available leaders only, if possible).
        max_request_size (int): The maximum size of a request. This is also
            effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server
            has its own cap on record size which may be different from this.
            This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer
            will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests.
            Default: 1048576.
        metadata_max_age_ms (int): The period of time in milliseconds after
            which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any
            partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new
            brokers or partitions. Default: 300000
        request_timeout_ms (int): Produce request timeout in milliseconds.
            As it's sent as part of ProduceRequest (it's a blocking call),
            maximum waiting time can be up to 2 * request_timeout_ms.
            Default: 40000.
        retry_backoff_ms (int): Milliseconds to backoff when retrying on
            errors. Default: 100.
        api_version (str): specify which kafka API version to use.
            If set to 'auto', will attempt to infer the broker version by
            probing various APIs. Default: auto
        security_protocol (str): Protocol used to communicate with brokers.
            Valid values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL. Default: PLAINTEXT.
        ssl_context (ssl.SSLContext): pre-configured SSLContext for wrapping
            socket connections. Directly passed into asyncio's
            `create_connection`_. For more information see :ref:`ssl_auth`.
            Default: None.

    Note:
        Many configuration parameters are taken from the Java client:
