CHANGES
--------

0.3.0 (2017-08-17)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Moved all public structures and errors to `aiokafka` namespace. You will no
  longer need to import from `kafka` namespace.
* Changed ConsumerRebalanceListener to support either function or coroutine
  for `on_partitions_assigned` and `on_partitions_revoked` callbacks. (PR #190
  by @ask)
* Added support for `offsets_for_times`, `beginning_offsets`, `end_offsets`
  API's. (issue #164)
* Coordinator requests are now sent using a separate socket. Fixes slow commit
  issue. (issuer #137, issue #128)
* Added `seek_to_end`, `seek_to_beginning` API's. (issue #154)
* Updated documentation to provide more useful usage guide on both Consumer and
  Producer interface.

0.2.3 (2017-07-23)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed retry problem in Producer, when buffer is not reset to 0 offset. 
  Thanks to @ngavrysh for the fix in Tubular/aiokafka fork. (issue #184)
* Fixed how Producer handles retries on Leader node failure. It just did not
  work before... Thanks to @blugowski for the help in locating the problem.
  (issue #176, issue #173)
* Fixed degrade in v0.2.2 on Consumer with no group_id. (issue #166)


0.2.2 (2017-04-17)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Reconnect after KafkaTimeoutException. (PR #149 by @Artimi)
* Fixed compacted topic handling. It could skip messages if those were
  compacted (issue #71)
* Fixed old issue with new topics not adding to subscription on pattern
  (issue #46)
* Another fix for Consumer race condition on JoinGroup. This forces Leader to
  wait for new metadata before assigning partitions. (issue #118)
* Changed metadata listener in Coordinator to avoid 2 rejoins in a rare
  condition (issue #108)
* `getmany` will not return 0 results until we hit timeout. (issue #117)

Big thanks to @Artimi for pointing out several of those issues.


0.2.1 (2017-02-19)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add a check to wait topic autocreation in Consumer, instead of raising 
  UnknownTopicOrPartitionError (PR #92 by fabregas)
* Consumer now stops consumption after `consumer.stop()` call. Any new `get*` calls 
  will result in ConsumerStoppedError (PR #81)
* Added `exclude_internal_topics` option for Consumer (PR #111)
* Better support for pattern subscription when used with `group_id` (part of PR #111)
* Fix for Consumer `subscribe` and JoinGroup race condition (issue #88). Coordinator will now notice subscription changes during rebalance and will join group again. (PR #106)
* Changed logging messages according to KAFKA-3318. Now INFO level should be less messy and more informative. (PR #110)
* Add support for connections_max_idle_ms config (PR #113)


0.2.0 (2016-12-18)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added SSL support. (PR #81 by Drizzt1991)

* Fixed Heartbeat fail if no consumers (PR #92 by fabregas)
* Added docs addressing kafka-python and aiokafka differences (PR #70 by Drizzt1991)
* Added `max_poll_records` option for Consumer (PR #72 by Drizzt1991)
* Fix kafka-python typos in docs (PR #69 by jeffwidman)
* Topics and partitions are now randomized on each Fetch request (PR #66 by Drizzt1991)


0.1.4 (2016-11-07)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Bumped kafka-python version to 1.3.1 and Kafka to 0.10.1.0.
* Fixed auto version detection, to correctly handle 0.10.0.0 version
* Updated Fetch and Produce requests to use v2 with v0.10.0 message format on brokers.
  This allows a ``timestamp`` to be associated with messages.
* Changed lz4 compression framing, as it was changed due to KIP-57 in new message format.
* Minor refactorings

Big thanks to @fabregas for the hard work on this release (PR #60)
